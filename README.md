   Quick Concept outline
   中文摘要說明與重點提問
   
###  1. Intro 
        教學影片固定的開頭和摘要說明

###  2. Tutorial Set Up
        在 git bash 輸入 npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json
        p: port
        w: watch

###  3. Switching from localStorage to REST API
        指派 api 連結

###  4. Using Async Await with useEffect hook
        在 useEffect 使用 Asynchronous 和 Await

###  5. Creating the fetch function
        指派 async 的 arrow function 為 fetchItems
        用 try block；並用 catch block 去捕捉 error

###  6. Not all fetch errors go to the catch block
        說明不會前往 catch block 的 fetch error
        TypeError: items.filter is not a function

###  7. Catching fetch error responses
        指派 Array 為 fetchError

###  8. Displaying errors in JSX
        顯示 紅字 Error: fail to patch

###  9. Simulating a slow REST API response
        模擬 REST API 會多慢回應

### 10. Track loading state
        追蹤 loading state

### 11. Displaying a loading message in JSX
        顯示載入的訊息

### 12. The complete fetch function inside useEffect
        概述完成的結果。

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
